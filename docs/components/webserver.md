# Web Server Component

The **Web Server** component handles HTTP requests, API endpoints, and web traffic for your Aegis Stack application.

## Current Implementation: FastAPI

FastAPI is the current web server implementation, chosen for its high performance, automatic API documentation, and excellent async support.

### Why FastAPI?

- **High Performance**: Built on Starlette and Pydantic, one of the fastest Python frameworks
- **Async Native**: Perfect match for Aegis Stack's async-first architecture  
- **Type Safety**: Automatic validation and serialization using Python type hints
- **Auto Documentation**: Generates OpenAPI/Swagger docs automatically
- **Modern**: Designed for Python 3.6+ with modern language features

### How It's Integrated

FastAPI is set up in the `app/backend/` directory:

```python
# app/backend/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

def create_backend_app(app: FastAPI) -> FastAPI:
    """Configure FastAPI app with all backend concerns"""
    
    # Basic CORS
    app.add_middleware(
        CORSMiddleware,
        allow_origins=["*"],
        allow_credentials=True,
        allow_methods=["*"],
        allow_headers=["*"],
    )
    
    # Include all routes
    include_routers(app)
    
    return app
```

### Adding API Routes

Routes are organized in `app/backend/api/`:

```python
# app/backend/api/health.py
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "service": "aegis-stack"}
```

Register routes in `app/backend/api/routing.py`:

```python
from app.backend.api import health

def include_routers(app: FastAPI) -> None:
    app.include_router(health.router, tags=["health"])
```

### Configuration

FastAPI is configured through the integration layer and runs with:

- **CORS enabled** for cross-origin requests
- **Automatic JSON serialization** 
- **Built-in validation** using Pydantic models
- **Exception handling** for clean error responses

### Development Features

- **Auto-reload** during development
- **Interactive docs** at `/docs` (Swagger UI)
- **Alternative docs** at `/redoc` 
- **OpenAPI schema** at `/openapi.json`

## Integration with Aegis Stack

FastAPI aligns perfectly with Aegis Stack's core principles:

- **Python-First**: Pure Python with excellent type safety
- **Async-Native**: Built for async/await from the ground up
- **Developer Experience**: Automatic validation, serialization, and documentation
- **Production Ready**: High performance with excellent error handling

## Performance Characteristics

FastAPI provides:

- **Async request handling** for high concurrency
- **Automatic validation** without performance penalty
- **JSON serialization** optimized with orjson under the hood
- **Middleware support** for cross-cutting concerns

FastAPI's async-first design allows Aegis Stack to handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently while maintaining type safety and developer productivity.
