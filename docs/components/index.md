# Components Overview

Aegis Stack follows a **Voltron philosophy** - each component provides a specific **capability** (like web serving, frontend UI, scheduling) with carefully chosen Python-native implementations that work seamlessly together.

## What Are Components?

Components provide core capabilities your application needs:

- **Web Server**: Handles HTTP requests and API endpoints
- **Frontend**: Provides user interface and interactions  
- **Scheduling**: Manages background tasks and cron jobs *(coming soon)*
- **Database**: Stores and retrieves application data *(coming soon)*
- **Caching**: Improves performance with data caching *(coming soon)*

## Current Components

### Web Server
**Implementation**: [FastAPI](webserver.md)  
**Capability**: High-performance async web framework for building APIs

### Frontend  
**Implementation**: [Flet](frontend.md)  
**Capability**: Python-based UI framework for desktop and web

## Component Philosophy

### Why This Approach?

1. **Python-First**: All components are Python-native for consistency
2. **Async Architecture**: Every component supports async/await patterns
3. **Standards**: Each component follows consistent integration patterns
4. **Evolution**: Start with solid foundations, add capabilities as needed

### How Components Work

Each component:

- **Integrates cleanly** with the lifecycle management system
- **Follows standard patterns** for configuration and setup
- **Supports async operation** for high performance
- **Provides examples** for common use cases

Each component is carefully chosen to maintain Aegis Stack's Python-first, async-native philosophy while providing the capabilities needed for modern applications.
